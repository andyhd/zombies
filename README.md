# Zombies

Inspired partly by Seb Lee-Delisle's live coding (part of) a game at State of the Browser the other week and partly because it's Ludum Dare 26, I've hacked up a simple little zombie game along the lines of the classic Robotron.

It's in Javascript and HTML Canvas, and should work in all modern browsers.

Temporarily using some sprites I nicked from somewhere on the web.

I might spend a bit more time on this tomorrow and submit it to the Ludum Dare Jam.
